based on utility

each agent could start with its own average expected utility
expected utility is updated when one agent meets another

if utility gain from another met agent is higher than average expected utility,
agent will signal "date"
if both agents signal "date", they will date

could put in parameters for attractiveness
could make 50% male 50% female
or add in continuum of sexuality
maybe add in a "10 point scale" for attractiveness

august: evolutionary indices for fertility and attraction
google scholar for that kind of thing
an easy way to think of parameters

mike:
an array of people with qualities
give people a radius and center for a person
would determine how often they would meet other people

give agents an option to stop dating, or to switch to another person

maybe have some sort of stopping rule that would result in marriage

august:
base stopping rule on variance of expected utility

----

have a list of other agents and their expected utility to you


add a variable for amount of time required to date to transition until they marry

might see "settling" for someone of lower attractiveness if you see a lot of people of lower attractiveness
it would lower your average expected utility
